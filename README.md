Welcome to my Github profile! I'm Brandon and I am currently studying computer science at the Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation. As a highly motivated and enthusiastic computer science student, I am deeply committed to pursuing a career in full stack development. Through a combination of self-study and collaboration with my peers, I am continuously working to hone my skills and achieve my goal of becoming a full-fledged full stack developer. 

My GitHub portfolio showcases a diverse range of coding projects, including those that I have independently developed, those that were inspired by instructional resources, and those that were created through collaborative efforts with other aspiring developers. For a comprehensive overview of my qualifications and expertise, I kindly direct you to my [portfolio website][https://www.bbkx.live/].
