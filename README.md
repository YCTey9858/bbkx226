Welcome to my Github profile! I'm Brandon and I am currently studying computer science at the Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation. As a highly motivated and enthusiastic computer science student, I am deeply committed to pursuing a career in full stack development. Through a combination of self-study and collaboration with my peers, I am continuously working to hone my skills and achieve my goal of becoming a full-fledged full stack developer. My GitHub portfolio showcases a diverse range of coding projects, including those that I have independently developed, those that were inspired by instructional resources, and those that were created through collaborative efforts with other aspiring developers. One of the things I enjoy about programming is the opportunity to develop something that will make our lives easier and more efficient. Apart from that, it allows me to collaborate with people from various disciplines who share my interests. It's fantastic to collaborate with other professionals who are striving toward the same goal. Aside from programming, I am also interested in mathematics. Mathematics, by coincidence, is a critical tool for solving the bulk of programming difficulties. As a result, I aspire to be a programmer and tackle problems with what I am good at.
